## Functionality

The game presents the user with a random verb, tense, and mood. The user is then prompted to enter the correct conjugation for a specific pronoun. The game provides feedback on the user's answer and allows multiple attempts.

## Dataset

The game utilizes a dataset of Spanish verb conjugations stored in a CSV file named `jehle_verb_database.csv`. This dataset contains various verb forms for different tenses and moods.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the following:

*   **`practice_verbs`:** Add or remove verbs to the list for practice.
*   **`tenses` and `moods`:** Select specific tenses and moods for focused practice.
